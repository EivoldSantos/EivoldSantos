## Approach to Technical Excellence

I operate from first principles: **business problems drive technical solutions, not vice versa.** This means:

- **Strategic Technology Selection:** Evaluating frameworks and architectures against project requirements and long-term maintenance—rejecting unnecessary complexity
- **Measurable Impact Focus:** Every significant architectural decision connects to business outcomes (cost, speed, reliability, scale)
- **Reliability by Design:** Building systems that serve customers consistently—defensive coding, graceful degradation, comprehensive testing
- **Knowledge Distribution:** Documenting architectural decisions and enabling team members to own systems confidently
- **Continuous Evolution:** Learning emerging patterns while respecting proven practices; balancing innovation with stability
